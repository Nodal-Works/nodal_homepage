Sanjay is a postdoctoral researcher at Chalmers University of Technology, specialising in accessibility, equity, and data-driven modelling. He holds an MArch from the University of Nottingham and a PhD in Urban Social Sustainability from Chalmers, where his research focused on developing activity-based models and synthetic populations to evaluate distributional impacts of urban accessibility. Before joining academia, he worked in the UK as a renewable energy consultant and tool developer, gaining experience in applying technical analysis to real-world decision-making. His research combines parametric design, transport modelling, and spatial analysis to generate evidence-based insights that support fair and sustainable urban policies. He has presented his work internationally and published in peer-reviewed journals on mobility, accessibility, and sustainability.
